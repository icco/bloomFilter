# BloomFilter

I was reading [Al3x's post][], and I was all, "hey, that would be fun to implement." So, here I am, attempting to learn rails and implement a basic version of what Al3x was proposing.

First I need to learn rails. It seems pretty straight forward, but I'm going to go through [Rails For Zombies][] first, just for shits and giggles.

Alright, Rails "learned".

There seems to be a pretty heavy debate on notHn whether or not to allow voting. I think a system along the lines of the following might work:

 * User A submits a post
 * User B sees the post and goes "this is hot shit". He nominates it for featuring.
 * If 10% of the user base (determined by users reputation) nominates the post, the post gets featured and User A gets x rep (I'm thinking 10).

Monetization? I'm thinking of using the same pay system that [pinboard.in][] uses. It seems to work, although I might put a ceiling on it...

## Features / Brainstorming

 * moderators
 * invite only?
   * benefit - helps limit users.
   * hash of invitee and inviter
 * submit links
 * show clicks and votes
 * show domain
 * show rules if you haven't posted in a month
   * make rules short
 * comment on links
 * vote on links
 * promote highly technical content

## Data

 * Items
   * title, url, text, parent, a user_id, and a date
   * if url, parent must be 0.
   * if url text must be null
   * if text, url must be null
 * Users
   * name, user_id, date joined, email, hashed pw
 * votes
   * direction, item id, user_id, date
   * direction will probably be an enum `{ 0 => flag, 1 => promote }`
      * What's the best way to deal with enums in rails?
